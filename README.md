# NPC Pleae
A Runelite Plugin that makes NPCs say "Pleae" when they die". There's already a plugin that makes you say Pleae when you die, but I just thought it'd be funnier the other way around.

## Java Dependency
JDK 11 - Seems to be the only JDK version that works for Runelite plugin development.

## Build Instructions - Eclipse (MacOS)
#### Configuring your project's run configurations:
1. Import the project into Eclipse.
2. Right click project -> Run > Run Configurations.
3. Set the Main class as com.pleaeTest.PleaePluginTest.
4. In Arguments > VM Arguments, add the `-ea` option.
5. In JRE > Alternate JRE, Select JDK11 from the dropdown menu.
6. Apply and save changes.

#### Configuring your Java compiler:
1. Find Eclipse menu > Settings > Java > Compiler.
2. Ensure that Compiler compliance level is 11.
3. Apply and save changes.
